== Introduction

The goal of this proof of concept is to showcase how it is possible to
expose and to use LDAP roles at {RH-SSO} 7.4 level and explore its
behavior.

== Prerequisites

. Docker and Docker Composed installed.

////
== Docker Compose configuration

----
include::docker-compose.yml[]
----
////

== Start

----
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose logs -f
----

== Ldap configuration

Now let's try to load users from LDAP into RH-SSO.

Open the {admin-console}.

* User: `admin`.
* Password: `admin`.

Click on {uri-user-federation}[User Federation], select `ldap` from the
drop-down.

Fill in the following values:

//* {uri-edit-mode}[Edit Mode^]: `UNSYNCED`
//* Sync Registrations: ON
* Vendor: `Red Hat Directory Server`
* UUID LDAP attribute: `entryUUID`
* Connection URL: `ldap://ldap-container:389`
* Users DN: `ou=People,dc=example,dc=org`
* Bind DN: `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org`
* Bind Credential: `admin`

Click on `Save` then click on `Synchronize all users`.

Now go to http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/master/users[Users] and click `View all users`.
You will see two new users `bwilson` and `jbrown`.
Both these users have the password `password`.
The user `jbrown` belongs to `ldap-admin` and `ldap-users` group.
The user `bwilson` belongs only `ldap-users` group.

=== Testing login with the created users

Logout the `admin` user.

Login with `bwilson` user.
Note that this user will receive a `Forbidden` page when trying to
administer the console.
But he will give access to manage their own account.

NOTE: The same will occurs if you repeat the steps by login with the
user `jbrown`.

=== Creating a ldap group mapper

Let's create an group named `ldap-admin-group`.
This `ldap-admin-group` has to be created with following mapping
properties:

* Name: `ldap-admin-group`
* Mapper Type: `group-ldap-mapper` (this the property to be selected when
creating this new ldap mapper).
* Ldap group DN: `ou=realmRoles,dc=example,dc=org`
* LDAP filter: `(cn=ldap-admin)`

Click on `Save` then click on `Sync LDAP Groups to Keycloak`.

Go to `Manage/Groups` and note that group `ldap-admin` will appear.

=== Adding SSO Role to keycloak group

The LDAP group (`ldap-admin`) can now be seen at Keycloak SSO level
after group synchronization performed previously.
So now will add a `Role` to this group.

Go to `Groups`/`ldap-admin`, select the group and click `Edit`.

Click on `Role Mappings`, select the `admin` role and click on `Add
selected`.

The keycloak `admin` role will be assigned as effective roles to this
`ldap-admin` group.
As a consequence, it means that any user which belongs to the
`ldap-admin` group will be automatically assigned the keycloak admin
role which allows him to connect to the admin console.

Logout the `admin` user and test the login with user `jbrown`.
You should not see a `Forbidden` page anymore.

=== Creating a new ldap-admin user

Create a new user (`paulojeronimo`) at LDAP level by copying
and editing the properties from `jbrown` user.
So, he will also be a member of `ldap-admin` group.
That is, the `uid=paulojeronimo,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org` will be
added as being part of the member `ldap-admin` group.

After that, this new user should be retrived at RH-SSO level.
Synchronization can be achieved by defining periodic sync, or on demand
sync.
Due to the keycloak `ldap-admin` group mapping, the new user gets also
automatically assigned keycloak effective admin rights.

=== Logging to the admin console with a new admin user-basis

It is now possible to log to keycloak admin console with a new user
different from admin, as this new user has got also the admin rights.

Test a login with user `paulojeronimo` expecting the same behavior as if
you were logged with the `jbrown` user.
